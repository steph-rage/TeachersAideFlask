# Teacher's Aide Website in Flask

Created as an alternative to the [original Teacher's Aide website](https://github.com/steph-rage/TeachersAideWebsite). Uses Flask to create the same structure, and to expand on it. Teachers can create or log in to a profile where they can create and store multiple choice tests. 

## Getting Started

This is a website, built using Flask. The original project was created to learn how servers work, and this project uses that knowledge to make a cleaner version using the tools available in Flask. The plan is to create the full functionality of the [Teacher's Aide](https://github.com/steph-rage/TeachersAide) command line program in website form.
